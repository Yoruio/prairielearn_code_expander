# prairielearn_code_expander
Expands prairielearn code preview element, and maximizes content view

This is a simple Chrome extension that makes it easier to view submitted code files on prairielearn.

It makes the preview window take up the entire height of the file, expands the width of the content view to fully encompass the width of the screen, and automatically shows the preview window of the file.

Also adds syntax highlighting with highlight.js, because I could.

Default code view:
